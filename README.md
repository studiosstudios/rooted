# rooted!
*Take control of either a bunny farmer or a carrot on a massive wheat field, where the tall wheat stalks hide most of the chaos that occurs within. The bunnies are desperate to secure their next week’s worth of dinner while the carrots are constantly running to save themselves and their children from their rooted fate!*

This alpha release demonstrates the integration of our game's customs shaders to model the wheat fields with rustling, along with more fleshed out networking events, UI additions to the menu scenes, some implementations of character animations, haptic feedback, and a full end-to-end game loop with win/lose condition support.
