*Take control of either a bunny farmer or a carrot on a massive wheat field, where the tall wheat stalks hide most of the chaos that occurs within. The bunnies are  desperate to secure their next week’s worth of dinner while the carrots are constantly running to save themselves and their children from their vegetable fate!*

This gameplay prototype demonstrates our core vision of the mechanics of the wheat field. The map consists of one carrot, one farmer, and four baby carrots. If playing as a carrot, colliding with a baby carrot will remove it from the map. Currently no interactions are implemented when playing as a farmer. 

Because we are testing rustling, the default setting for player visibility is **off**. However we have included a toggle to change the visibility to more align with what we would expect in the final version of our game. Additionally, to see locations of baby carrots to compare with the rustling, we suggest turning on debug mode. 

We recommend playing on mobile to get the full control of velocity and thus rustling that is not possible on desktop, but it may be easier on desktop to toggle between the different settings.
