# Platform Demo

This demo should be familar to students who have taken 3152.  It is the second part of the physics lab from that class, rewritten in CUGL.  We will have the ragdoll demo later.

Once  you control the game differently on desktop and mobile.  On desktop, you control the character with the arrow keys and shoot with the spacebar (as you do in lab).  On mobile the controls are **very** different.  You press the side of the screen that of the direction you want to go; pressing in the bottom center will fire.

Jumping on mobile is perhaps the most unusual control of all.  You flick up on the **opposite side** of what you are pressing to move.  So if you are moving right, you flick up to jump on the left.  If you are moving left, you flick up to jump on the right. These platforming controls were adopted from the early mobile game **Type:Rider**.
