//
//  This module provides the connected ropebridge from 3152. This time it is fully
//  assembled for you.  Note that this module handles its own scene graph management.
//  As a ComplexObstacle owns all of its child obstacles, it is natural for it to
//  own the corresponding scene graph.
//
//  WARNING: There are a lot of shortcuts in this design that will do not adapt
//  well to data driven design. This demo has a lot of simplifications to make
//  it a bit easier to see how everything fits together. However, the model
//  classes and how they are initialized will need to be changed if you add
//  dynamic level loading.
//
//  This file is based on the CS 3152 PhysicsDemo Lab by Don Holden (2007).
//  This file has been refactored to support the physics changes in CUGL 2.5.
