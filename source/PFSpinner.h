//  This class provides a spinning rectangle on a fixed pin, as ComplexObstacles
//  always make joint management easier.
//
//  WARNING: There are a lot of shortcuts in this design that will do not adapt
//  well to data driven design. This demo has a lot of simplifications to make
//  it a bit easier to see how everything fits together. However, the model
//  classes and how they are initialized will need to be changed if you add
//  dynamic level loading.
//
//  This file is based on the CS 3152 PhysicsDemo Lab by Don Holden (2007).
//  This file has been refactored to support the physics changes in CUGL 2.5.
