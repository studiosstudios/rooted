     * microseconds. By that we mean if the method {@link draw} is called at
     * time T, then this method is guaranteed to have been called exactly
     * floor(T/s) times this session, where s is the fixed time step.

     * This method is always invoked in-between a call to {@link #preUpdate}

     * possible that this method is called multiple times between those two

     * that must be deterministic, such as the physics simulation. It should
