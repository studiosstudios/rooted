//  This module is a singleton providing display information about the device.
//  Originally, we had made this part of Application.  However, we discovered
//  that we needed platform specfic code for this, so we factored it out.
//
//  This singleton is also responsible for initializing (and disposing) the
//  OpenGL context.  That is because that context is tightly coupled to the
//  orientation information, which is provided by this class.
//
//  Because this is a singleton, there are no publicly accessible constructors
//  or intializers.  Use the static methods instead.
