# rooted!
*Take control of either a bunny farmer or a carrot on a massive wheat field, where the tall wheat stalks hide most of the chaos that occurs within. The bunnies are desperate to secure their next week’s worth of dinner while the carrots are constantly running to save themselves and their children from their rooted fate!*

This open beta release has new assets for the wheat, grass, farmer, carrots and planting spots, larger maps with map randomization, accelerometer integration for escaping from the farmer when caught, a new wheat rustling effect, refined baby carrot AI and new menu UI and in-game UI. Because we do not have haptics support for Android, this our release is for **iOS only**.
